NewHorizonDesign - Custom Music Folder
======================================

Place your own music files here to enable background audio during conversations.

Supported formats:
  • .wav (recommended, no extra dependencies)
  • .mp3 (requires pygame[base] + ffmpeg)

Suggested usage:
  • message_send.wav   → Plays when you send a message
  • agent_reply.wav    → Plays when agent replies
  • background.mp3     → Loops as ambient background music

How to enable:
  1. Install pygame (optional): pip install pygame
  2. Place audio files in this folder
  3. Restart NewHorizonDesign
  4. Click the 🎵 button in top bar to control playback

Note: Music is DISABLED by default if pygame is not installed.
      Your privacy is respected — no audio is transmitted anywhere.
